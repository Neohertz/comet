# comet.ts
A fast plugin framework inspired by Flamework.

## v1.0.4
- Added `record()` member that abstracts undo/redo.
- Added `createCopy` paremeter to the `mount()` method overload that handles passing GuiBase objects.
- `createButton()` now has an optional parameter to allow it to be used outside of the viewport (in script view).
- Added `setEnabled()` to button class.
